										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Shah Rukh Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali collaborated on the blockbuster film &#8220;Devdas&#8221; 22 years ago. According to the latest reports, the duo is likely to reunite for another film soon. Bhansali initially announced his film &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; with Salman Khan and Alia Bhatt in 2019; however, the film which was slated for a theatrical release in 2020, did not commence shooting. The latest news regarding the film is that Bhansali has put a hold on his dream project &#8220;Baiju Bawra&#8221;, starring Ranveer Singh, as he is now keen on directing &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; with Shah Rukh Khan, according to a report on India.com.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Jawan’, ‘Pathaan’ to compete with Hollywood action films for Vulture’s Stunt Awards</strong><br />
Several Indian media outlets have reported that the &#8220;Dunki&#8221; actor and Bhansali have already had multiple meetings regarding this film. The light-hearted romantic comedy is expected to be made soon. Reports also suggest that the lead female role might be played by Deepika Padukone instead of Alia Bhatt. The storyline of &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; centres on a couple spanning different generations who develop feelings for each other. A man in his forties experiences love for a woman younger than him, prompted by his bedridden father&#8217;s condition. The father decides to transfer his wealth to his son, but with the condition that the son must fall in love and improve his lifestyle as per the father&#8217;s wish. Reports also hint that the production has already begun, and fans might receive the announcement of &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; very soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the world of celebrity romance, speculations about a summer engagement are swirling around pop sensation Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce. Although neither party has officially confirmed the news, insiders close to the couple are dropping hints about a potential engagement set to unfold on their one-year anniversary in July. Sources suggest that the power couple, deeply in love with each other, might be gearing up for a fairytale ending with the exchange of a sparkling ring. Reports from Page Six reveal that Taylor Swift&#8217;s camp is buzzing with excitement over the possibility of the couple taking a significant step forward in their relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier speculations in December fueled engagement rumours, with suggestions that Kelce might propose during Taylor Swift&#8217;s birthday, especially given her frequent appearances at Chiefs games. However, recent rumours indicate a deliberate decision to avoid a winter holiday proposal to prevent it from appearing rushed. Despite Valentine&#8217;s Day approaching, it seems Kelce won&#8217;t pop the question on this romantic occasion, as the couple is cautious about not rushing into their next chapter. While Kelce has expressed feeling pressure about selecting the perfect gift, insiders indicate that the duo has mapped out their plans and is sticking to their original timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to sources, the anticipated engagement is earmarked for their one-year anniversary in July. Although the timeline of their blossoming romance remains somewhat private, sparks seemed to fly around 2022, with public sightings becoming more frequent by the summer of 2023. The confirmation of their relationship came during Taylor Swift&#8217;s Argentina leg of the &#8220;Era&#8217;s Tour&#8221;, where she publicly kissed Kelce during a concert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Did Taylor Swift manifest her relationship with Travis Kelce years ago?</strong><br />
In a recent interview, Kelce shared that their connection began after he missed a chance to meet Swift at her Kansas City concert, with a mutual friend playing cupid. The couple has since been spotted at various sporting events and social gatherings, solidifying their public presence. Swift, 34, expressed gratitude for the time they had to privately get to know each other away from public scrutiny. She shared, &#8220;We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I&#8217;m grateful for because we got to get to know each other.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Taylor Swift surpasses Elvis Presley at Billboard 200</strong><br />
Adding to the engagement buzz, a source claimed that Kelce sought Swift&#8217;s father&#8217;s blessing last year, indicating a serious intent to take their relationship to the next level. The source revealed, &#8220;Scott has been asked for his blessing and has wholeheartedly given it, and Travis has been talking to friends about a ring.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In a recent development, acclaimed filmmaker Wes Anderson has announced an impressive cast for his upcoming project, set to commence production later this year. The stellar lineup includes seasoned actors Bill Murray from &#8220;The French Dispatch&#8221;, Michael Cera of &#8220;Life &amp; Beth&#8221;, and Benicio Del Toro, also known for his role in &#8220;The French Dispatch. The film, co-written by Anderson and his longtime collaborator Roman Coppola, is shrouded in secrecy regarding its plot details. Anderson hinted at the project during a September 2023 interview with Deadline, revealing that he and Coppola had just completed the script featuring Benicio Del Toro before the onset of a writers&#8217; strike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additional details about the cast remain undisclosed, but given Anderson&#8217;s penchant for assembling large ensembles, more names are expected to emerge in the coming weeks. Wes Anderson&#8217;s recent production &#8220;Asteroid City&#8221; is an alien invasion dramedy centred around a writer crafting a world-renowned fictional play. The film stars Jason Schwartzman as Augie Steenbeck, a grieving father navigating a journey with his tech-obsessed family in a small rural town called Asteroid City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anderson also treated audiences to a series of star-studded Netflix shorts, including &#8220;Poison,&#8221; &#8220;The Rat Catcher,&#8221; &#8220;The Swan,&#8221; and &#8220;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,&#8221; based on the works of Roald Dahl. While Michael Cera joins the world of Wes Anderson for the first time, Bill Murray and Benicio Del Toro have a history of collaboration with the esteemed director. Del Toro made his debut in Anderson&#8217;s second-to-last feature, &#8220;The French Dispatch,&#8221; sharing the screen with longtime collaborator Bill Murray, who has been associated with the filmmaker since his breakout feature &#8220;Rushmore&#8221; in 1998.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">An old interview with Taylor Swift has some of her fans believing she predicted her relationship with Travis Kelce long ago. In 2009, the superstar singer talked to Glamour magazine and was asked what a relationship would &#8220;look like&#8221; for her, reports CNN. It&#8217;s always going to be long-distance, even if I date the boy who lives next door to me in Nashville. I&#8217;ll be flying to see him and flying him places to see me,&#8221; Swift said at the time. &#8220;It feels like it would involve more scheduling, and I already deal with a lot of scheduling in my life. Of course, if I met somebody who was worth it, I would probably stop thinking that way!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She has traveled to watch him play football, and he has gone overseas to watch her on her &#8220;Eras Tour.&#8221; Also, the pair have gone back and forth from his home in Missouri and hers in New York City to spend time together. In the Glamour article 15 years ago, Swift was also asked if she would only &#8220;date someone at a similar level of success. I think it&#8217;s more a question of confidence. I wouldn&#8217;t want to be with a pushover who would let me make all the plans and have all the control,&#8221; Swift remarked. It&#8217;s really natural for me to go into planning mode, but I&#8217;d rather be with someone who has his own voice and passion and ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plenty of people think that sounds just like Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs who is clearly passionate about football and comfortable enough with fame that he has been very public in his relationship with Swift. It also bears mentioning that Kelce appears to have done a bit of manifesting himself, as he pursued Swift initially by famously using one of the friendship bracelets from her concerts to get her attention. All of which adds up to the belief that Kelce might just be the endgame for Swift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new comic book chronicles the rise to stardom of South Korea&#8217;s K-pop music sensation BTS and their recent transition to military service. TidalWave Comics has added the 22-page book to its Fame series, which uses the comic medium to shine a light on musical acts. Since their 2013 debut, BTS have become a worldwide sensation with their upbeat hits and social campaigns aimed at empowering youth. The glossy chronicles how the seven singers became famous &#8211; and their switch from pop stars to soldiers. All able-bodied men in South Korea aged between 18 and 28 must serve in the military for between 18 and 21 months as part of efforts to defend against nuclear-armed North Korea. Some have won exemptions or served shorter terms, including Olympic medalists and prize-winning classical musicians. Some lawmakers had called for BTS to be exempt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ana Ofelia Murguía, the esteemed Mexican actress known for lending her voice to Mama Coco in the Oscar-winning Disney Pixar animation &#8220;Coco&#8221;, passed away at the age of 90 on December 31. She portrayed the role of the great-grandmother to a Mexican boy who sets on a journey through the Land of the Dead, unraveling family secrets as he aspired to be a musician. Mexico&#8217;s National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature emphasised that Ana Ofelia Murguía&#8217;s career was &#8220;vital for the performing arts of Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A particularly poignant moment in &#8220;Coco&#8221; is the scene where Mama Coco and her great-grandson Miguel share a touching rendition of the song &#8220;Remember Me&#8221;. Born in Mexico in 1933, Murguía was honoured with a special lifetime achievement Golden Ariel Award in 2011 during a ceremony recognising outstanding contributions to the Mexican cinema industry. This prestigious accolade, celebrating her illustrious career spanning over 40 years in stage, film, and television, was shared with director and writer Jorge Fons. Additionally, she secured the title of Best Supporting Actress at the Ariel Awards in 1979, 1986, and 1996 for notable performances in films like 1994&#8217;s &#8220;La Reina de la Noche&#8221; (The Queen of the Night). The movie depicted a female cabaret artiste reconstructing her career in Mexico after departing Berlin following an incident with the Nazis.</p>
